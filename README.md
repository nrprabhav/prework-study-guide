# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was made in the process of learning how to build a webpage. It was my first project to integrate HTML, CSS, JavaScript onto a webpage. All this was done using a workflow that used Git to manage the versions of the project. This project serves as an introduction to managing more complicated software projects in big teams where several people are working on the project at the same time. I learnt the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git as I did the project.
